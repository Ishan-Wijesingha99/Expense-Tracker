## Description
X-pensify is a full-stack application that uses React.js in the frontend and ASP.NET Core with C# in the backend. 

Bootstrap and Redux are also used in the frontend.

In the backend, msSQL Server is used for the database and Entity Framework Core is used as the ORM. Both the backend code and SQL database are hosted on the popular cloud computing platform Azure.

X-pensify features complete JWT user authentication with client-side and server-side validation. Once a user is logged in, they can add new expenses from a wide range of categories, these expenses are listed in order so the user can access them chronologically. Users can also delete or edit an expense they've already added. Users also get a breakdown of their expenses with a statistics page that offers more information.
